            <p class="meDesc">Kamusta! I am a 2nd year university student studying computer science in Canada. 
                I got very interested in designing websites this year, I'm currently reading Learning Web Design, Fourth Edition
                by Jennifer Niederst Robbins.
                The site I am making is heavily inspired by geocities 
                I want to bring that time (I never lived in) back of customized websites, blogs, and links to follow and read.
                My goal is a simple website that also showcases my personality</p>
